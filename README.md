 odin-recipes

A recipe book to store a handful of favorite recipes on the web using basics learned through the first half of the foundations course of the Odin Project. Using concepts such as listing, anchors, imaging, and different text styles.

Project will be revisited to add styling once CSS is learned- this is just the barebones for now.
